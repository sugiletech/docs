# Traffic Manager

- Uses DNS to direct clients to a specific service endpoint IP address based on the rules of the traffic routing method that's used. Clients connect directly to the selected endpoint. 
- Isn't a proxy or gateway.
- Doesn't see the traffic that passes between the clients and the service; it just gives clients the IP address of where they need to go.
